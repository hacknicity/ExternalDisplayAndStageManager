#  External Display and Stage Manager Sample Code

Apps that support external display scenes will show that scene on an external display when the main app is running on the iPad's display. That is, opening the app on the iPad will prevent Stage Manager being used on an external display. It could be desirable for an app to continue to support the legacy external display interface on iPhone and iPads that don't support Stage Manager.

This sample code demonstrates how the legacy, non-interactive, external display support in an iOS/iPadOS app can be configurable at run time. See my Medium article [External Display Support versus Stage Manager on iPadOSÂ 16](https://hacknicity.medium.com/external-display-support-versus-stage-manager-on-ipados-16-149e15dc700e) for more information.
